## Manual Synchronization

### When to use manual sync
Your solution may not be successfully synced to GitHub if you update the text in the editor too quickly after submission.
It is necessary to wait for 4 seconds (until the spinner stops) after submitting the solution before entering new characters, switching languages, or switching editors.
During this period, your solution is being pushed to GitHub, and the website should maintain its layout without alteration.

### How to use manual sync previous submissions
   - Navigate to the submission you want to sync
   - Select the submission from the list
   - Click the manual sync button
   - Wait for the sync to complete
     
### Note
While the manual sync process is less than ideal, it provides a reliable backup when automatic sync fails. We're continuously working to improve the sync reliability. If you find a better solution, your contributions are welcome!
